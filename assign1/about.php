        <h3>Features: Bootstrap</h3>
        <p>Bootstrap includes a responsive, mobile first fluid grid system that appropriately scales up to 12 columns as the device or viewport size increases. 
          One of the enhancements I have used in my assignment is Bootstrap. I've utilised Bootstrap on all of my sites to create a fluid layout utilising the grid system, and I've also used some of Bootstrap's components, such as the nav bar, 
          to improve the user experience and make it easier for me to develop these elements than if I did it myself.</p>
